To create an Excel sheet that includes **BMR**, **BMI**, **Food**, **Exercise**, and **Tips** based on the data you've provided, we'll organize it in a structured format. I'll show you how the data can be represented in Excel, and I'll also provide a sample Excel structure you can use.

### Step 1: Breakdown of Columns

Here’s how you can organize the data in Excel:

1. **BMR Category**: The category of Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) based on calorie intake.
2. **BMI Category**: The category of Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height.
3. **Goal**: The goal (e.g., weight loss, maintenance, energy support).
4. **Food**: Recommended meals for each category.
5. **Exercise**: Recommended exercises for each category.
6. **Tips**: Extra tips for each category (e.g., hydration, portion control, etc.).

### Step 2: Organize Data Into Excel Table

### Step 3: Formatting the Excel Sheet

Now that we have the data structured, here's how you can set up the Excel file:

1. Open Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.
2. Create a new sheet, and label your columns as shown above: **BMR Category**, **BMI Category**, **Goal**, **Food**, **Exercise**, and **Tips**.
3. Copy the data and paste it under the respective columns.

#### Example of the Excel Sheet Layout:

| **BMR Category**       | **BMI Category**  | **Goal** | **Food**                                                                                           | **Exercise**                                                                                           | **Tips**                                                                                            |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BMR < 1200 kcal/day** | **Obesity (BMI 30+)** | Improve metabolism | Spinach smoothie with berries, chia seeds, almond milk; Grilled turkey, roasted veggies, quinoa.   | Walking: 20–30 minutes brisk pace. Yoga: Beginner poses. Light Strength Training: Squats, wall push-ups. | Hydrate well. Focus on small, frequent meals. Avoid processed foods.                             |

### Step 4: Additional Steps (Optional)

- **Formatting**: Use bold headings, borders, and different colors to make the Excel sheet visually appealing and easy to read.
- **Filtering**: Enable filtering on each column to allow sorting and searching for specific categories or goals.
- **Formulas**: If needed, you can add formulas to calculate totals or averages (e.g., total calories, daily intake) based on the data provided.

### Conclusion

This Excel sheet will help you track dietary and exercise recommendations based on both **BMR** and **BMI** categories. You can expand this by adding additional columns for specific calorie counts or more detailed food items and exercise regimens if needed.
